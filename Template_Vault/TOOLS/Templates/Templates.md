# Templates 
The basic templates include a [Conversation Tracker](Conversation%20Tracker.md) and [Quick Note](Quick%20Note.md).

[Conversation Tracker](Conversation%20Tracker.md) is used to document interactions in [Org_platforms](Org_platforms.md) including checking-in, notes, and tasks. 

[Quick Note](Quick%20Note.md) is used for more spontaneous interactions in [Org_platforms](Org_platforms.md).

Both the [Conversation Tracker](Conversation%20Tracker.md) and [Quick Note](Quick%20Note.md) record information about [PEOPLE](PEOPLE.md), [PRODUCTS](PRODUCTS.md), [PLATFORMS](PLATFORMS.md) (both [Org_platforms](Org_platforms.md) and [Tech_platforms](Tech_platforms.md)) as well as [TASKS](TASKS.md) and [TOOLS](TOOLS.md).
