# Templates 
The basic templates include a [[Conversation Tracker]] and [[Quick Note]].

[[Conversation Tracker]] is used to document interactions in [[Org_platforms]] including checking-in, notes, and tasks. 

[[Quick Note]] is used for more spontaneous interactions in [[Org_platforms]].

Both the [[Conversation Tracker]] and [[Quick Note]] record information about [[PEOPLE]], [[PRODUCTS]], [[PLATFORMS]] (both [[Org_platforms]] and [[Tech_platforms]]) as well as [[TASKS]] and [[TOOLS]].
