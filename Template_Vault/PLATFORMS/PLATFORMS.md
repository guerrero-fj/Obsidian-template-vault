# PLATFORMS 
 [PLATFORMS](PLATFORMS.md)  are all the spaces where [PEOPLE](PEOPLE.md) come together to discuss ideas and create [PRODUCTS](PRODUCTS.md). Presence in these [PLATFORMS](PLATFORMS.md) can be virtual/digital (e.g., [Tech_platforms](Tech_platforms.md)) or in person (e.g., [Org_platforms](Org_platforms.md)). I call these [PLATFORMS](PLATFORMS.md) also because these virtual/physical spaces provide a space for interactions  to occur. These interactions are modulated by differences in power, position, and priviledge.
