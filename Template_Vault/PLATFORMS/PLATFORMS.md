# PLATFORMS 
 [[PLATFORMS]]  are all the spaces where [[PEOPLE]] come together to discuss ideas and create [[PRODUCTS]]. Presence in these [[PLATFORMS]] can be virtual/digital (e.g., [[Tech_platforms]]) or in person (e.g., [[Org_platforms]]). I call these [[PLATFORMS]] also because these virtual/physical spaces provide a space for interactions  to occur. These interactions are modulated by differences in power, position, and priviledge.
